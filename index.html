<div class="Article">
  <p>   On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed the first case of COVID-19 in the United States. By March 11, 2020, the <a href="https://www.who.int/">World Health Organization</a> declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and consequently, on March 15, 2020, the United States began its lockdown in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus. 
  </p>

  <p> The nationwide lockdown affected various facets of life such as education, the workforce, and any sort of pastimes/hobbies. However, one of the sectors that were most heavily impacted was the medical field. In terms of COVID-19, hospitals nationally faced difficulties in dealing with the new and unexpected virus as there was a shortage of nurses across the country as well as troubles with hospitals reaching maximum capacity. 
  </p>

  <p> As a result, much like the rest of the world, the medical field had to adapt to the circumstances that were prevailing. 
  </p>

  <p> Similar to how jobs and schools began implementing Zoom in order to connect everyone from their homes, medical professionals began increasingly offering telehealth visits to limit exposure and the spread of the virus. 
  </p>

  <p> According to a study conducted by the <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/surveys/2019/dec/2019-commonwealth-fund-international-health-policy-survey-primary">Commonwealth Fund</a>, in 2019 the United States (50%) and Sweden (58%) were the top countries whose medical professionals offered virtual functions, such as viewing test results or planning appointments. However, after the pandemic, within the first quarter of 2020, there was a 154% increase in virtual medical visits. Consequently, the United States experienced an increase in outpatient visits from less than 1% prior to the pandemic to 13% within the first 6 months. 
</p>

<p>Medical professionals had to adjust and deal with these outlandish circumstances. <em> “In my near 50 years of working in the medical field, I had never diagnosed a patient virtually, it felt odd” </em>, said Dr. Madias, Professor of Cardiology at Mount Sinai Hospital. Dr. Madias joked about his traditional methods and his preference for face-to-face interaction with patients, which is a sentiment that many professionals share. However, <em>“even though there has been a definite impact on doctor-patient relationships, we have also seen a (positive) difference in results”</em>. According to Dr. Madias, the use of zoom or mobile applications to conduct ordinary, routine medical checks has helped mitigate the effect of faulty readings such as the infamous <em>“white coat syndrome”</em> - an increase in blood pressure readings when taken by a doctor because of the patients fear for hospitals. 
</p>

<p>As of April 11, 2022, there is a wide distribution of data pertaining to the use of telehealth across the country. States such as North Dakota (17.0% telehealth visits) are transitioning back to in-person visits, meanwhile, the District of Columbia (39.6% telehealth visits) is reinforcing and growing its use of virtual visits.

<p> After 2 years of combatting and dealing with the pandemic, the United States is experiencing positive trends pertaining to COVID-19. Since the spike in cases during the months of January and February, reaching heights of 1.3 million positive cases in one day, because of the spread of the Omicron variant, cases have been on the downfall; As of April 11, there were 35 thousand positive cases. Additionally, vaccinations are becoming more prominent and the results have been evident.

<p> However, has the potential downfall of COVID-19 affected telehealth? 
</p>

<p>In the last year, there has been a 5.7% decrease in virtual visits across the country. However, about 20% of medical patients are still outpatients. According to studies by the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6943a3.htm">CDC</a>, between the years 2020 to 2025, telemedicine is supposed to increase by 31%, which would result in about 50% of patients visiting their doctors virtually. 
  </p>

  <p>While some might find that figure surprising, virtual appointments have received positive feedback from both patients and professionals. Based on a survey conducted by <a href="https://www.singlecare.com/blog/telehealth-survey/">SingleCare</a>, 42% of patients that participated nationally reported extreme levels of satisfaction, while 36% reported being somewhat satisfied; only 2% reported being extremely dissatisfied. In terms of the medical professionals, and as Dr. Madias ensured, more than 60% of physicians expressed comfort in using telehealth to meet with their patients. Furthermore, more than 50% of physicians expressed satisfaction with their virtual work.  
  </p>

</script>

<p> Lastly, the pandemic left detrimental financial consequences. Millions of people lost or left their jobs and as a result commodities and necessities became more difficult for some. The use of telehealth helped a lot of patients in saving money. In a study conducted by the <a href="https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/library/newsletters/health-watch-newsletter/2020/hw-2020-iss-02-20-2-hughes.pdf">Society of Actuaries</a>, it was reported that patients saved anywhere between $19 and $121, mainly from not having to visit the ER. 
</p>

<p> Ultimately, the pandemic impacted our world in a variety of ways. Life as once known is no longer and society has had to cope with the circumstances. A new era of technology has allowed for innovations and new ways for people to carry out their routines. However, will the rise in telehealth use diminish or stay prevalent in our lives going forward?
